# All-Time Olympic Medal Counter: Explanation
## Quentin Lehn & Lisa Pugh

  The idea behind this project was to come up with a way to display which countries have won the most Olympic medals to this day.
  We wanted to work with data involving olympic medal counts of different kinds of medals such as bronze, silver, and gold and we
  also wanted to work with the different kinds of Olympics such as summer, winter, or just the Olympics in general. Both group 
  members contributed equal amounts of the brainstorming. When it came to the actual coding, both group members again contributed
  equally in terms of ideas and implementing them.
  
  Quentin helped come up with a decent amount of the webscraping part and also helped with the error/exception handling. He was 
  the one who found the right webpage we could use with the right table and information we were in need of. When it came to 
  merging the dataframes, Lisa helped a lot with that part as well as with the formatting and sorting of the dataframes, the main 
  part of the program, and folium map at the end. Both of us worked together to make sure the project moved in the direction that 
  we wanted to and spent the time to work out any roadblock we encountered together. For the poster, Quentin was the one who 
  designed, assembled, and printed it, while Lisa had contributed the background and what information about the project to include 
  on it. With the demo, we both plan on contributing equally again with explaining our project and answering any questions asked.
